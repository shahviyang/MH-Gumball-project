# MH-Gumball-project

What we have come up with so far:
- Plotly dashboard holding space for input and graph display
- Button with storage features to store guess values to a data-frame
- Histogram display of results
- Box plot data to show min, max, quartile values etc.
- Button to hide/show results histogram, so that people can guess without bias

Currently working on:
- Better decorating the html and css parts (maybe include a MH logo)
- Working on histogram statistics

- Time sleep for auto-hide plot results (60 seconds).
- Add timestamp to each guess value data, so we can plot weekly guesses and all time guesses too.
