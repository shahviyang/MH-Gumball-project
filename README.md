# MH-Gumball-project

What we have come up with so far:
- Plotly dashboard holding space for input and graph display
- Button with storage features to store guess values to a data-frame
- Histogram display of results

Currently working on:
- Button to hide/show results histogram, so that people can guess without bias
- Better decorating the html and css parts (maybe include a MH logo)
- Working on histogram statistics
